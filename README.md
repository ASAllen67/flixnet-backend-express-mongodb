# FlixNet backend, super fancy MongoDB edition
The backend for this project was originally made with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, but the model relationships were so trivial that I decided to shift away from a relational database and try out Express.js and MongoDB.


### Model Relationships
User has many entries (three entry types: completed, backlogged, favorited)

That's all.
